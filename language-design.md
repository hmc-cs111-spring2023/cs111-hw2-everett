**Question**

Pick three quotes from the readings about language design. Good candidates
are:

- Something you agreed with / resonates with your own experience
- Something you disagree with
- Something that is interesting, a new idea or perspective you'd like to remember
- Something you didn't understand

For each quote, describe what it was about the quote that led you pick it.

**Response**

"Next to English, all computer programming languages are small; as we write code, we must stop now and then
to define some new term that we will need to use in more than one place" [Steele, 1998].
- This quote really made me think about the speakers objective in giving this talk. I had never really comapered
programming languages to the English language because in my mind they were so different from each other. Once the 
speaker presented this idea, I really stopped to think about how small and less complex programming languages
are compared to spoken languages that have existes for thousands of years. Even a programming language like Python, 
which is large and has more primitive terms compared to other languages, is small compared to a spoken language 
which has far more primitve to communicate with.

"API design is not a solitary activity. Show your design to as many people as you can, and take their feedback seriously. 
Possibilities that elude your imagination may be clear to others" [Bloch, 2006].
- I like this quote because it resonates with lots of advice I've heard over the course of my lifetime. I have been told to 
get as many sets of eyes on my work that I can, whether it is a paper, coding project, or a piece of art I created, input from
others will help you realize things you may have not considered. Particularly, I really liked the last sentence, I thought
that it summed up this idea nicely.

"You can't please everyone so aim to displease everyone equally" [Bloch, 2006].
- I intially didn't choose this quote but I found myself thinking about it when reading the grayscale article. I really like it
because it made me think about when you create something that is shared with others, don't let your own values override the creation 
process. Instead, keep in mind what the genral public would find most useful, which will allow your project/ideas to catch on.

**Question**

How would you know a well-designed language? What are the symptoms? How would
you know a poorly designed language? What are the symptoms?

**Response**

Well designed:
- Fills a specific purpose
- Easy to understand/learn
- Can be built on/added to
- Accumulated features/use cases over time

Poorly designed:
- Small and immutable
- Large and overly complex
- Does not fill a niche
- Tries to do too much

**Question**

"How might the themes of Growing a Language relate to ideas from the Fowler reading?" 

**Response**

I was able to identify a connection between the two readings as they both comment on when small languages are useful.
Growing a Language says that once "a small language fills a niche, it is hard to take its place" [Steele, 1998]. 
This directly reflects the domain-focus part of Fowelers definition of a DSL, which is "a limited language is only useful if it has 
a clear focus on a small domain. The domain focus is what makes a limited language worthwhile" [Fowler]. These two readings have 
taught me that small languages are really only useful if they have a specific domain-focus that fills a niche; this has made it more
clear to me why DSL's are useful to understand/study.

**Question**

In what way is an API a language?

**Response**

- Good API's get reused
- Names matter
- People must learn to read and write it
- Should be easy to use

**Question**

What does the post on grayscale tell us about the process of API design?

**Response**

Names are important, specifics matter. Before breifly learning about API design in the Bloch reading, I would have thought that this
discussion was silly and not very important. However, I can now see why people may take different stances on this topic and determine
a standard for people to agree on. API design must keep the general public in mind. Even if seems the best to you, make sure others agree.

**Question**

The Pavlus article mentions the researchers' comments that people preferred
"natural-language replacements for some of the more abstruse syntax". In other
words, people found it easier to work with code that looks more like a human language (e.g.,
English). Consider the following quote by William R. Cook, one of the creators
of AppleScript:

> The experiment in designing a language that resembled natural languages (English
> and Japanese) was not successful. It was assumed that scripts should be
> presented in “natural language” so that average people could read and write
> them. … In the end the syntactic variations and flexibility did more to confuse
> programmers than to help them out. It is not clear whether it is easier for
> novice users to work with a scripting language that resembles natural language,
> with all its special cases and idiosyncrasies. The main problem is that
> AppleScript only appears to be a natural language: in fact, it is an artificial
> language, like any other programming language. … even small changes to the
> script may introduce subtle syntactic errors that baffle users. It is easy to
> read AppleScript, but quite hard to write it.
> [[Cook 2007, page 1-20]](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1238844.1238845)

Are these two experiences of natural languages at odds with one another? Would
you choose to include natural language in the design of a DSL? If so, how might
you do so? If not, why not?

**Response**

Absolutely not. I can see why it is extremely difficult to write code in a natural language, we all have different ways 
of saying the same thing. To try and force somebody to speak in a way that is different than they usually do is to rewrite
the rules that thier language consists of. I think that it is much easier to learn a simple language and build your own terms within it.
However, I do recognize the benefits of using a natural language, when learned and understood it is a very powerful tool to use.
